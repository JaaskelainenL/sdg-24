This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project built for Solve the SDGs 2024 hackathon. 
The program is meant to be a webpage where users can report problems and they can be marked as fixed.
Our team wasn't very experienced and our time was limited by external factors beyond our control (teammate had a mandatory event to attend).


## Running it

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

It is possible to create a new database with dummy data with
```bash
npm run db-init
```


The site launches at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
